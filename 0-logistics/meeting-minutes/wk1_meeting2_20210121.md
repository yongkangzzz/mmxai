supervisor

# Attendees
all group members, Dr. Pranava Madhyastha, Prof. Lucia Specia

# Agenda
1. General progress update (gitlab setup)
2. Technical progress 
3. Confirm next steps and project objectives (e.g. min requirements) 
4. Q&A

# Details
* the team reported progress in terms of project setup and research so far which reveiced good feedback from the supervisors
* so far we have looked at methods that work really well for image inputs but it should be noted that data in hateful-memes challange comprises of image and text
    * potential challange for this kid of data is that within an image there could be texts that occlude 
* minimum requirements
    * running software such that users can input sample data for the chosen tasks and the web interface should output intuitive explaination with visualisation
    * the minimum task could be an implementation of the hateful-memes challenge
* possible improvement
    * additional task: VQA (which could be viewed as a classification problem as the output words are from a subset)
    * taking user pre-trained models via ONNX protocal?? to generate explaination
* the team is free to allocate tasks/workloads (e.g. building web interface last) if it does not affect progress and output 
* future meeting times should be fixed 5 pm on Thursdays

# Actions
* send calendar invites recurring every two weeks 
* start applying interpretability models to text inputs and start thinking/trying a multimodal model such as hateful-memes
* send drafted version of report 1, esp requirements part to be agreed with supervisors

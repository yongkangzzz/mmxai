# Details

## LIME
Junqi J and Yongkang Z reported the progress about the LIME package:

* Now LIME can be applied to mmbt model
* Seems text dominates the explanation
* Tried to use an object detector but unable to extract features from the image
(e.g. the gun was not detected)

### Suggestion from Pranava
* Only tested on one example - need to try this on running more example
* If this is still the case for more example, then LIME might be a bad idea
* Could try to use open images for the object detector

## SHAP
Zhi W reported the progress about the LIME package:

* Trying to cat the image and text, similar technique to LIME group
* Text is occluding the image
* Next step would be to look into the input of mmf and dig out the base torch model

### Suggestion from Pranava
* Try to look into the sub routine of SHAP

## TorchRay
Bojia M and Chenyu Z summarised the progress:

* Difficulties in only looking into the image as text occludes the image


### Suggestion from Pranava
* Could try alternating minimisation
* Could use inpainting to remove the text from image

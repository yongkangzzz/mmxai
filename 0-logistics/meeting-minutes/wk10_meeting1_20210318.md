3. Q&A

# Details
## Group progress
Junqi J reported the group progress to the supervisors:
1. interpretabily method for each group and impainting have been finished
2. interpretabily method for a whole system is needed
3. one locally running prototype has been finished
4. still have some interface problem

## LIME
Junqi J and Yongkang Z reported the progress about the LIME package:

* change some mmf source codes add flags
* make a function to output a uniform interpretation(high level sentences)
* platt scaling problem(reduce range hoped but obtain opposite result, either 0 or 1)
* mmf have two different ways(image,features). what component for features in sample list to input is not sure


### Suggestions from Dr. Pranava Madhyastha
1. sckitlearn may help for platt scaling problem and will send an email to talk about it
2. for mmf: input is object detections bounding box, features may refer to object features, so converting features in processor before in sample list

## SHARP
Zhi W presented the progress related to SHARP package:

* SHARP and LIME show similar interface
* concatenate image and text features
* text feature fewer than images. different from lime, after perturbation hard to concatenate these features
### Suggestions from Dr. Pranava Madhyastha
* take images into components like lime, bounding box to make semantic words


## inpainter
* succesfully remove white words
* sometimes does not work if big or small text
### Suggestions from Dr. Pranava Madhyastha
* if lower confidence after inpainting means robust

## backend and frontend
* introduce how it works(1 min for sharp, 2 mins for lime, torchray currently unavailable)
* explanation to improve. a better and uniform explanation is required

# Details
* From this week on, each member should upload their weekly summary report, summarising what has been done, and the approximate time spent.
* Three interpretation models that were allocated to subgroups for research were discussed; the team compared and shared the features each method offers and how we could potentially apply them in the backend of the software.
The methods are:
    * Lime
    * Shap
    * TorchRay
* The team discussed what the final interface could look like roughly
    * users could input a model and a set of samples, the software should be able to generate explainations for each of the input samples.
    * this will need to be confirmed at next supervisor meeting
* Next steps:
    * each subgroup should continue researching the other terpretation models
    * in addition, the MMF framwork should be studied
    * upon completion, each subgroup should try and apply 1 interpretation model on an hateful-memes model

# Next supervisor meeting agenda

2. Technical progress / Q&A if any
3. Confirm next steps
4. Discuss project objectives (e.g. min requirements)

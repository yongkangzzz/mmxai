# Things done this week

 - Created a custom MMBT interface which only required image inputs as torch.Tensor. The original text inputs is defined during object initiation (custom MMBT interface).
 - Applied extremal-perturbation method from TorchRay to the custom MMBT interface. Some outputs are reasonable.

# Challenges encountered

- Difficulties in applying extremal-perturbation method to the text input

# Working time

 - ~20 hours

# Objectives for next week

 - Dig into the other methods mentioned in the TorchRay paper

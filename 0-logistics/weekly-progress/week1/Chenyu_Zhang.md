# Things done this week

 - Familiarised with deep learning neural network concepts and pyTorch
 - Read through the TorchRay documentations and the relevant paper of the extremal perturbation method
 - Briefly read through the mmf usage

# Challenges encountered

- Complicated theory in the extremal perturbation paper and couldn't understand all of them
- There are 7 other methods used by TorchRay which also need to be reviewed

# Working time

 - ~12 hours

# Objectives for next week

 - Understand the code used in the TorchRay extremal perturbation method and apply this method to basic NN model in mmf
 - Review the other attribution methods in the TorchRay codebase

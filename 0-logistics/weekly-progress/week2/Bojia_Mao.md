# Things done this week
 - Investigated MMF, set up MMF enviornment on google colab and train the hateful meme model.
 - Learning the code of extremal perturbation algorithm implemented in TorchRay
 - Investigation on captum multi-modal interpretation algorithm

# Challenges encountered

- Understand the code of extremal perturbation algorithm, in order to be able to modify it from single-modal method to multi-model algorithm.

# Working time

 - ~5 hours

# Objectives for next week

 - Further Investigation on captum multi-modal interpretation algorithm, start adding multi-modal feature to the extremal perturbation algorithm.

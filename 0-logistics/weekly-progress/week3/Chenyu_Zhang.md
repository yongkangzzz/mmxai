# Things done this week

 - Downloaded pre-trained mmf hateful meme model
 - Trying to create a new MMBT model which only takes one image input with pre-defined text

# Challenges encountered

- MMBT model takes two imput while PyTorch works on model which takes one input

# Working time

 - ~10 hours

# Objectives for next week

 - Apply PyTorch to the modified one-input MMBT model
 - (Optional) extend PyTorch MMBT with both MMBT inputs

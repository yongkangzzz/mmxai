# Things done this week

 - Report 1 writing (group)
 - Run and test MMf and LIME_image on colab



# Working time

 - ~7 hours

# Things didn't go as planned

 - Explanation generation with LIME and MMF too slow, took 3 hours
 - Problem occured when using LIME to interpret hateful memes(seems 0 weight for image and text dominates the prediction)

# Objectives next weeks

- Try to debug LIME(changs the source code) and create a new class to solve the problem with LIME and MMF
- Investage other models

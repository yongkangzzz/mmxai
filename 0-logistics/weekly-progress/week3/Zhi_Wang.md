# Things done this week

 - Loaded MMF pretrained model (MMBT) and be able to inference arbitrary sample
 - Connected pretrained model to SHAP and make rough explaination

# Working time

 - ~10 hours

# Things didn't go as planned

 - Inference time not ideal
 - Realised selection of parameters like number of background distribution samples a performance hurdle

# Objectives next weeks

 - Investigate how to combine text and image inputs into single input and visualise
 - Investigate how changing the number of samples in background distribution affect output
 - Web dev (if time permits)

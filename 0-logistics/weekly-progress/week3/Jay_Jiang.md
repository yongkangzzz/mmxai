# Things done this week

 - Report 1 writing (group)
 - Loaded MMF pretrained model and made single predictions with it
 - Generated image-only explanations for hateful meme model using LIME

# Working time

 - ~8 hours

# Things didn't go as planned

 - Explanation generation with LIME and MMF too slow, took 3 hours

# Objectives next weeks

To be done by 2021/03/07

 - Accelerate explanation generation by bypassing variable type conversion
 - Generate text explanations using LIME
 - Develop new explanation class in LIME source code concatenating text and image interpretable features
 - Classify interpretation results, for example, cases where features contribute to the decision equally
